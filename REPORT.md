- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?

the highest quantity item sold was Touring-3000 Blue 54 with 24175 sales, the lowest quantity item sold was chain stays with 169 sales

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
As stated in the question there were products that did not have a price.
Some of the middle initials were listed as ' instead of null or nothing.
These problems were not necessarily problems in data but problems in seen in the company:
    employee 23 did not have any sales. This means the employee either needs to be let go or trained better.
    of the 500 products only 71 of them had sales, this means that products can be cut to make room for higher ticket items and boost overall profit for the company.
